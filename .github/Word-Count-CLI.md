# TerminalCraft Project Submission

## Project Details

1. **What is the name of your project?**
   Word Count CLI

3. **How many hours did you spend developing this?**
   _(I spent approximately 8-9 hours developing this tool. Unfortunately, my Wakatime tracker was blocked by parental controls, so I couldn’t use it to track the exact time spent.)_

4. **Briefly describe what your project is. What makes it unique?**
   _(The Word Count CLI is a Python-based tool that allows users to quickly count the number of words in .txt files within their project folder via the command line. The unique feature is that it provides a simple solution for platforms that don’t have a built-in word count feature. This tool is specifically designed to be a quick and easy workaround for students or anyone needing a word count function in environments that don’t support it.)_

5. **How many people have tested your extension?**
   _(4)_

6. **On What operating systems have you tested this project?**
   _(MacOS/Linux)_

7. **Does your project include a Readme file with instructions on how to use it?**
   _(Yes)_

## Additional Comments

(I’ve put a lot of thought into making this tool simple and easy to use. It should be particularly helpful for students in my school’s platform, which doesn’t have a word count feature. If you have any feedback or suggestions, feel free to let me know!)
